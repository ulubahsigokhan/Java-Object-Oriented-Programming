# Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

A learning-focused Java repository dedicated to **Object-Oriented Programming fundamentals**, built with clarity, clean code, and real-world understanding in mind.

---

## 📌 Purpose of This Repository

This repository exists to help you understand **how and why Object-Oriented Programming works in Java**. Each concept is introduced gradually with simple examples that focus on understanding, not complexity.

This is a **practice and learning repository**, designed to strengthen core Java OOP skills before moving into advanced topics.

---

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Covered

This project demonstrates the main pillars of Object-Oriented Programming:

* Classes and Objects
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Abstraction
* Constructors
* Method Overriding
* `this` and `super` keywords

Each concept is isolated into its own example to keep learning focused and confusion-free.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

```text
src/
 └── oop/
     ├── ClassExample.java
     ├── ObjectExample.java
     └── ...
```

* One concept per class
* Clear naming conventions
* No unnecessary complexity

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Code

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Open the project in your IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code)

3. Navigate to the `src` folder

4. Run any class that contains a `main` method

## 🧹 Code Style Philosophy

This repository follows simple but strong principles:

* Readability over cleverness
* One responsibility per class
* Clear method names
* Refactor when clarity can be improved

Comments are used only when they add learning value.

---

## 📚 Who This Is For

This repository is ideal for:

* Java beginners learning OOP
* Students studying object-oriented design
* Developers revisiting Java fundamentals
* Anyone wanting clean OOP examples

Basic Java syntax knowledge is recommended.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

Planned or possible additions:

* Interfaces vs abstract classes
* Composition vs inheritance
* Real-world mini projects
* Unit testing basics
* Design pattern introductions

---

## 📝 Notes

This repository reflects a learning journey. Improvements, refactors, and experimentation are part of the process.

Understanding **why** OOP works is more important than memorizing syntax.
